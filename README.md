üßë‚Äçüíª React State Management Projects
Overview
Welcome to the React State Management Projects repository! This repository is a collection of projects I have built to practice and master various state management techniques in React. It includes implementations using:

useReducer: A powerful hook for managing complex state logic.
useContext: React‚Äôs built-in Context API to share state between components without prop drilling.
Context API: Sharing state globally across components.
Redux: A widely-used state management library, enabling predictable state container management for JavaScript applications.
Each project in this repository focuses on demonstrating practical use cases of these state management techniques, with detailed breakdowns of the logic, components.
